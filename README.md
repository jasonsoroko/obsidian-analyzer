**Summary**

The application “Obsidian Analyzer” inspects an Obsidian vault, suggests improvements, and automates link creation.

Core analysis features

MultiVaultAnalyzer performs a full-vault scan, discovering folders, analyzing them individually, finding cross-folder connections, and computing a health score. It returns a VaultAnalysis dataclass with aggregate metrics and folder breakdowns
Generated reports summarize metrics like total notes, words, links, orphaned notes and more, exporting to Markdown for user review
Automatic and safe linking

AutoLinker automatically inserts wiki links into notes based on content analysis suggestions
SafeAutoLinker provides guarded link insertion with safety levels and backup creation to limit risk
AI-powered capabilities

AISemanticLinker uses OpenAI to detect semantic relationships between notes and suggest bidirectional links where confidence is high
ContentGapAnalyzer identifies missing content or bridge notes in the vault using AI analysis and can generate detailed gap reports
Command‑line tools and examples

The scripts/analyze_vault.py CLI analyzes an entire vault and outputs a summary along with optional JSON/Markdown reports
scripts/auto_link.py exposes auto-linking from the terminal with options for confidence threshold, dry-run mode, and interactive selection
Additional scripts such as ai_safe_auto_link.py combine AI link suggestions with the safe auto-linker for cautious automated linking
Overall, the project provides tooling to inspect an Obsidian vault’s structure, recommend improvements, automatically insert safe links, discover content gaps, and report on vault health. The application’s CLI scripts and example programs demonstrate workflows for vault analysis, auto-linking, and AI-assisted enhancements.
