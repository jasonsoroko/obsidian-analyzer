Taking coding notes in Obsidian 

**Use Maps of Content (MOCs) as your navigation backbone** instead of folders. Think of them as dynamic index pages that link to related notes.

**Core MOCs you'd want:**

- `Python Development MOC` - Links to all your Python notes
- `Tools & Setup MOC` - Links to configuration, tooling notes
- `Learning Projects MOC` - Links to tutorials, experiments
- `Quick Reference MOC` - Links to cheat sheets, commands

## Note Naming Strategy

**Use descriptive, searchable names:**

```
Python - Modern Project Setup with uv and direnv
Python - Bleeding Edge Hygiene Workflow
Tools - Obsidian Note Organization
Reference - Python Package Managers Comparison
```

**Why this works:**

- Searchable with `Cmd+O` quick switcher
- Self-organizing (all Python notes cluster together)
- No mental overhead of choosing folders

## Tagging Strategy (Borrowed from Your Bear Experience)

**Use a 3-tier tag system:**

**Tier 1 - Domain:** `#python`, `#tools`, `#learning`, `#reference`

**Tier 2 - Type:** `#setup`, `#workflow`, `#troubleshooting`, `#comparison`

**Tier 3 - Status:** `#active`, `#archived`, `#draft`, `#needs-update`

**Example note tags:**

```
#python #setup #active
#tools #workflow #reference
```

## The Power of Backlinks + Aliases

**Create "concept" notes that become natural hubs:**

```markdown
# uv Package Manager

aliases: [uv, python package manager, pip replacement]

Modern Python package manager that's 10-100x faster than pip...

## Related Notes
- [[Python - Modern Project Setup with uv and direnv]]
- [[Python - Bleeding Edge Hygiene Workflow]]
```

The aliases make it linkable from anywhere as `[[uv]]` or `[[pip replacement]]`.

## Daily/Weekly Review Notes

**Create temporal anchor points:**

```markdown
# 2025-W22 - Python Learning

## What I Learned This Week
- [[Python - uv Package Manager]] - Game changer for speed
- [[Python - Type Hints Evolution]] - Modern Python is typed Python

## To Explore Next Week
- FastAPI deep dive
- Ruff configuration options

## Questions/Blockers
- How to handle legacy dependencies with uv?
```

## Practical Navigation Workflow

**1. Start with Quick Switcher (`Cmd+O`)** - Type partial names to find notes fast

**2. Use Graph View strategically** - Not for daily navigation, but to discover unexpected connections

**3. Create "Dashboard" notes:**

```markdown
# Python Development Dashboard

## Current Projects
- [[Project - FastAPI Learning App]]
- [[Project - CLI Tool with Click]]

## Recently Updated
- [[Python - Modern Project Setup with uv and direnv]]
- [[Python - Bleeding Edge Hygiene Workflow]]

## Quick Access
- [[Reference - Python Cheat Sheet]]
- [[Tools - My Development Environment]]

## Learning Queue
- [ ] AsyncIO deep dive
- [ ] SQLModel exploration
- [ ] Type system advanced features
```

## Template System

**Create templates for consistency:**

**Template - Python Tool:**

````markdown
# {{title}}

## What It Does
Brief description...

## Installation
```bash
# Installation commands
````

## Configuration

```toml
# Config examples
```

## Usage Examples

```python
# Code examples
```

## Alternatives

- [[Alternative Tool 1]] - Why not this one
- [[Alternative Tool 2]] - Different use case

## Related Notes

- [[Setup Note]]
- [[Workflow Note]]

Tags: #python #tools #active

```

## Plugin Recommendations

**Essential for navigation:**
- **Templater** - Dynamic templates
- **Tag Wrangler** - Better tag management
- **Recent Files** - Quick access to recent notes
- **Starred** - Pin important notes
- **Quick Switcher++** - Enhanced search

## The "Everything is Searchable" Philosophy

**Instead of organizing, make everything findable:**
- Rich, descriptive titles
- Good tags
- Aliases for different ways you might think about something
- Cross-references in MOCs
- Regular review notes that surface connections

## Example Structure for Your Python Notes

```

Python Development MOC ├── Python - Modern Project Setup with uv and direnv ├── Python - Bleeding Edge Hygiene Workflow  
├── Python - Type Hints and Modern Practices ├── Tools - uv vs pip vs poetry Comparison ├── Reference - Python 3.13 New Features ├── Workflow - Daily Python Development Routine └── Learning - FastAPI Tutorial Notes

Tools & Setup MOC ├── Obsidian - Note Organization System ├── Development Environment - Linux Setup ├── Terminal - Modern CLI Tools └── Git - Advanced Workflows

```

**The beauty of this system:**
- No folder hierarchy to maintain
- Natural discovery through backlinks
- Scales infinitely
- Works with your brain's associative memory
- Tags provide multiple organizational dimensions

Start with a few MOCs and let the system grow organically. The key is making every note easily findable through multiple paths!
